<h2>Welcome to the Terminal</h2>

<p>
  You have access to a real terminal, but don't worry — we've added some
  safeguards to help you learn safely.
</p>

<p>
  Think of this panel and the command area below as your <strong>training wheels</strong>,
  helping you gain your balance as you learn. You can't accidentally break anything here.

    <li>Every command is explained before you run it</li>
    <li>Color-coded safety indicators show you what's safe</li>
  </ul>
