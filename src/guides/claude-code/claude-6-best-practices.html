<h2>Best Practices</h2>

<p>
  Get better results from Claude Code by following these patterns.
</p>

<section>
  <h3>Be Specific</h3>
  <p>
    Good prompts include context:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Less helpful:</strong> "Fix the bug"</li>
    <li><strong>More helpful:</strong> "Fix the null pointer error in UserService.getProfile()"</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Mention file names, function names, error messages, and expected behavior.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h3>Review Changes Before Accepting</h3>
  <p>
    When Claude shows you a diff (the changes it wants to make):
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Read through the changes</li>
    <li>Make sure they match what you asked for</li>
    <li>Check that nothing unexpected is being modified</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    It's faster to catch issues before accepting than to fix them after.
  </p>

<section>
  <h3>Iterate and Refine</h3>
  <p>
    If the first result isn't perfect, guide Claude:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>"Good, but use async/await instead of callbacks"</li>
    <li>"Can you make this more concise?"</li>
    <li>"Actually, put that in a separate file"</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Claude learns from your feedback within the conversation.
  </p>

<section>
  <h3>Use Git Commits as Checkpoints</h3>
  <p>
    Create commits between major changes:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>Ask Claude to make a change</li>
    <li>Review and test it</li>
    <li>Commit if it works</li>
    <li>Move to the next change</li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    This gives you safe points to return to.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h3>Let Claude Explore First</h3>
  <p>
    For unfamiliar codebases, ask questions before requesting changes:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>"How does authentication work in this app?"</li>
    <li>"What would be the best place to add this feature?"</li>
    <li>"Are there existing patterns I should follow?"</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section>
  <h3>Break Down Large Tasks</h3>
  <p>
    Instead of "Rewrite the entire auth system":
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>"Explain the current auth flow"</li>
    <li>"What are the problems with it?"</li>
    <li>"Design a better approach"</li>
    <li>"Implement step 1 of the new design"</li>
  </ol>
</section>

<section>
  <h3>Trust But Verify</h3>
  <p>
    Claude is helpful but not perfect. Always:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Run your tests after changes</li>
    <li>Check that the app still works</li>
    <li>Read the code Claude wrote — you own it now</li>
  </ul>
