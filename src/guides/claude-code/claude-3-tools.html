<h2>Understanding Claude's Tools</h2>

<p>
  Claude Code uses "tools" to interact with your computer.
  When you see Claude using a tool, it's being transparent about what it's doing.
</p>

  <h3>What Are Tools?</h3>
  <p>
    Tools are specific actions Claude can take. Instead of just talking,
    Claude can actually read files, write code, and run commands.
  </p>
  <p>
    You'll see tool names appear as Claude works — this is good!
    It means you can see exactly what's happening.

  <h3>Reading Tools</h3>
  <div class="safety-item">
    <span class="safety-dot safe"></span>
    <span><strong>Read</strong> — Opens and reads a file's contents</span>
  </div>
  <div class="safety-item">
    <span class="safety-dot safe"></span>
    <span><strong>Glob</strong> — Finds files matching a pattern (like *.js)</span>
  </div>
  <div class="safety-item">
    <span class="safety-dot safe"></span>
    <span><strong>Grep</strong> — Searches file contents for specific text</span>

  <p>
    These tools only look at things — they don't change anything.

  <h3>Writing Tools</h3>
  <div class="safety-item">
    <span class="safety-dot moderate"></span>
    <span><strong>Write</strong> — Creates a new file or replaces an existing one</span>
  </div>
  <div class="safety-item">
    <span class="safety-dot moderate"></span>
    <span><strong>Edit</strong> — Makes targeted changes to part of a file</span>
  </div>
  <p>
    These tools modify your code. Claude will show you what it plans to change
    and ask for permission first.

  <h3>Research Tools</h3>
  <div class="safety-item">
    <span class="safety-dot safe"></span>
    <span><strong>WebSearch</strong> — Searches the web for information</span>
  </div>
  <div class="safety-item">
    <span class="safety-dot safe"></span>
    <span><strong>WebFetch</strong> — Retrieves content from a specific URL</span>
  </div>
  <p>
    Claude can look up documentation, examples, or current information online.

  <h3>Why This Matters</h3>
  <p>
    Seeing the tools helps you understand what Claude is doing and why.
    If you see Claude using <strong>Read</strong> on several files before answering,
    it's gathering context. If you see <strong>Edit</strong>, it's about to change code.
