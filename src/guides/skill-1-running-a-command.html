<p>
  The terminal works by typing commands and running them.
  Let's learn how Ask Terminal helps you along the way.

  <h3>Step 1: Type a Command</h3>
  <p>
    Look at the command area below the terminal. You'll see a <code>$</code> prompt
    and a text input. Type your command there.

  <p>
    Try typing: <kbd>ls</kbd>
