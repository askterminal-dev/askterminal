<h2>Understanding Safety Features</h2>

<p>
  Ask Terminal has built-in safeguards to help you learn without worry.
  Let's understand how they protect you.
</p>

<section>
  <h3>Experience Levels</h3>
  <p>
    Your experience level controls which commands you can run. You can see and
    change your level by clicking the badge in the bottom-right corner.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Beginner</strong> — Only safe, read-only commands allowed</li>
    <li><strong>Intermediate</strong> — Most commands allowed, dangerous ones need confirmation</li>
    <li><strong>Advanced</strong> — Full access to all commands</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Start as a Beginner. As you get comfortable, level up to unlock more commands.

  <h3>Safety Indicators</h3>
  <p>
    Every command shows a colored dot indicating its safety level:
  </p>
  <div class="safety-item">
    <span class="safety-dot safe"></span>
    <span><strong>Green</strong> — Safe commands that only display information</span>
  </div>
  <div class="safety-item">
    <span class="safety-dot moderate"></span>
    <span><strong>Yellow</strong> — Commands that create or modify files</span>
  </div>
  <div class="safety-item">
    <span class="safety-dot dangerous"></span>
    <span><strong>Red</strong> — Powerful commands that can delete files or change system settings</span>
  </div>
</section>

<section>
  <h3>Blocked Commands</h3>
  <p>
    In Beginner mode, yellow and red commands are <strong>blocked</strong>. You'll see
    a message explaining why, and the Run button will be disabled.
  </p>
  <p>
    This isn't a limitation — it's protection while you learn. You can always
    see what a command would do, even if you can't run it yet.
  </p>

<section>
  <h3>The Command Input Area</h3>
  <p>
    Notice that you type commands in the panel <em>below</em> the terminal, not
    directly in the terminal itself. This is intentional:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>You see explanations <em>before</em> running anything</li>
    <li>Safety checks happen automatically</li>
    <li>You can review and edit before pressing Run</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    In Intermediate mode, you can enable typing directly in the terminal if you prefer.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h3>Confirmation Dialogs</h3>
  <p>
    In Intermediate mode, dangerous commands (red) will ask for confirmation
    before running. You'll see exactly what the command does and can choose
    to proceed or cancel.
